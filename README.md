# Python-Course
I learned Python during my university studies, but I wanted to refresh and consolidate my knowledge with this course.

This repository contains my notes, exercises, and practice code from a complete Python course.  
It showcases the concepts I have learned and implemented, ranging from basic data structures to advanced topics like multiprocessing and context managers.
